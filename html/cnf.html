<h3>News</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>5 Jul 2014: Fixed a bug for inputs less than 5.

<p><li>23 Nov 2007: Fixed a bug that caused the generator to occasionally
output clauses with boolean constants instead of variables. 

<p><li>1 Jan 2006: The old CGI servers has been replaced by a new one running a
different OS. The code for the simplification has not been recompiled for the
new system yet and hence the simplification of the output does not work now.

<p><li> 10 Feb 2005: Fixed a bug in the simplifier that caused it to sometimes
drop some clauses.

This program generates a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) predicate
associated with the integer and the circuit that you specify. The
predicate will be satisfiable if the integer is composite and it will
be unsatisfiable if the integer is prime. The predicate is in the <a
href="http://www.satlib.org/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps">DIMACS
format</a> used in <a
href="http://www.satlive.org/SATCompetition/index.jsp">SAT
competitions</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><blockquote>
For those who want more information, the full source code for the
predicate generation is collected in <a href="cnf1.hs">this Haskell
file</a>. The source code for the simplifier is in <a
href="sat.web">this WEB file</a>.
</blockquote></p>

<p>The program produces one or two web pages as output depending on
whether you select <i>Simplify output</i> or not. 

<p> The web page for the output predicate begins with a lot of
comments. If you are interested, you can use these comments to
determine the meaning of each variable in the predicate, and you can
discard them if you are not interested. Some of the variables give the
bits of the product. Those variables will appear in unit clauses that
force them to take on the appropriate value so that they represent the
number you input. Some of the variables give the bits of the first
factor. Some of the variables give the bits of the second factor. The
remaining variables give the values on the wires in the multiplication
circuit that is simulated by the predicate. All of the details should
be clear from reading the comments. Likewise the details of how the
circuit is wired together should be clear.

<p> To ensure that no factors are found for prime numbers, the circuit
requires, for <b><code>n</code></b>-bit inputs, that the first factor
have no more than <b><code>(n-1)</code></b> bits and that the second
factor has no more than <b><code>n/2</code></b> (rounded up) bits.

<p> The two basic types of multiplication circuits that are
implemented are:
<ol>
<li>the carry-save multiplier, and <li>the <a
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/person_info?csw">Wallace</a>-tree
multiplier (IEEE Trans. on Electronic Comp., 1964).
</ol>
If you select <i>recursive</i>, then the circuit is built based on the
algorithm of Karatsuba (as taken from <a
href="http://www.oup-usa.org/toc/tc_0030720443.html">The Analysis of
Algorithms</a> by <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~pwp">Purdom</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~cbrown/">Brown</a>). When the
number of bits in each input becomes less than 20 bits, the recursive
multiplier reverts to the Wallace tree multiplier. (The recursive
option is only recommended for very large problems.) 

<p> For the two basic types of multipliers, the circuit begins by
forming all the products <b>a<sub>i</sub> * b<sub>j</sub></b> where
<b>a<sub>i</sub></b> is a digit from the first number factor and
<b>b<sub>j</sub></b> is a digit from the second factor. These products
are then added, but each multiplier circuit differs in the details of
how they carry out the addition.

<p> In the carry-save circuit, row <b><code>i</code></b> of the
circuit adds the product from row <b><code>i</code></b>
<b>(a<sub>i</sub> * b<sub>*</sub>)</b> with the sum and carry (shifted
one column) to obtain a new sum and a new carry. A special adder is
used to add the final sum and final carry.  The products from the
first row must go through a linear number of adders to get to the
special adder.

<p> In the Wallace-tree circuit, the rows (with appropriate shifts)
are added in groups of three to produce sums and carries. The sums and
carries (with appropriate shifts) are again added in groups of three,
and this is repeated until there is just one sum and one carry. Then a
special adder is used to add the final sum and the final carry. The
products from any row need go through only a logarithmic number of
adders before they get to the special adder.

<p> The adder type specifies the special adder. The
<b><code>n</code></b>-bit adder uses the algorithm (adapted to binary
numbers) taught in grade school. It is simple, but carries must
propagate through a linear number of addition stages.

<p> The fast adder is a <b><code>log</code></b>-time adder taken from
<a
href="http://www.whfreeman.com/college/book.asp?id_product=1002000383">Foundations
of Computer Science</a> by <a
href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~aho/">Aho</a> and <a
href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~ullman/">Ullman</a>. If you select
<i>Fast</i> for adder type and <i>Wallace</i> for multiplier type,
then no path in the circuit has length longer than a small constant
times the number of bits needed to specify the input integer. It is an
interesting experimental question as to whether such SAT problems are
easier.

<p>The predicate generation is written using a <a
href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> program (inspired by the <a
href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/~koen/Lava/papers.html">Lava
library</a>). The idea is that one writes completely standard
executable specifications for the circuits, and then exploits Haskell
type classes to get a non-standard interpretation of the primitives
which generates CNF clauses. For example, a half-adder is specified as follows:
<pre>
halfAdd :: Circuit m => (Bit,Bit) -> m (Bit,Bit)
halfAdd (a,b) = 
  do carryOut <- and2 (a,b)
     sum <- xor2 (a,b)
     return (carryOut,sum)
</pre>
In the standard interpretation, <code>and2</code> is defined as the
usual operation on booleans:
<pre>
  and2 (Bool x, Bool y) = return (Bool (x && y))
</pre>
In the symbolic interpretation, <code>and2</code> instead generates
CNF clauses relating its input variables to its output variables:
<pre>
  and2 (b1, b2) = 
    do v <- newBitVar
       let or1 = Or [b1, b2, notBit v]
           or2 = Or [b1, notBit b2, notBit v]
           or3 = Or [notBit b1, b2, notBit v]
           or4 = Or [notBit b1, notBit b2, v]
       addDesc [or1,or2,or3,or4]
       return v
</pre>
This approach to generating the predicates is appealing as it enables
us to use the full power of Haskell to write circuits naturally, test
the circuits extensively using the standard interpretation, and then
simply turn a switch on to use the symbolic interpretation. 

<p> The initial output has many trivial features, including unit
clauses. The simplifier applies rules to simplify the predicate
without changing the set of solutions. The simplifier has fixed size
limits, so it may not work for large problems. (It can handle a
maximum of 15,000 variables and 63,000 clauses.)

<p> The simplifier repeatedly applies the following rules to the
CNF predicate:
<ol>
<li>Remove subsumed clauses. (If the literals in clause A are a subset
of those in clause B, then remove clause B.)  

<li> Do resolutions where at least one parent is subsumed. (If clause
A is <b>x l<sub>1</sub> ... l<sub>n</sub></b> and clause B is <b>-x
l<sub>1</sub> ... l<sub>n</sub> y<sub>1</sub> ... y<sub>n</sub></b>
then replace clause B with <b>l<sub>1</sub> ... l<sub>n</sub>
y<sub>1</sub> ... y<sub>n</sub></b>.  

<li> Substitute for equalities. (If clause A is <b>l<sub>1</sub>
-l<sub>2</sub></b> and clause B is <b>-l<sub>1</sub>
l<sub>2</sub></b>, then replace all occurrences of
<b>l<sub>2</sub></b> with <b>l<sub>1</sub></b> except in clauses A and
B.)

</ol>
